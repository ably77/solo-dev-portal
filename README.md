WHAT IS THIS?
This is a portal starter for displaying your Open API schemas from a Solo backend. It is ready to drop in to an environment, but can also be updated with images and colors to better personalize the portal experience for your users.

SETUP

- ??Do we need this fleshed out or should this just be a link to the docs/separate repo on how to get the backend setup??
  Definitely need:
  (1) Download with different parameters (eg, Redoc vs Swagger)
  (2) Running for first time (even if this links to backend, we should expand with front-end needs)

PERSONALIZE IT

- Colors and Style Defaults
- Images & Icons
- Logo
- Deeper styling redos
- Deeper code explanation

HOSTING

- ?? Do we need to explain this here? This feels like it is too situational for this type of README ??
